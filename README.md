# Track-Following-Car
This code was written in C++ and programs an Arduino Nano. 
The car has three sensors, each consisting of an IR LED, phototransistor, and resistors.
Each sensor has a range of numerical readings that, when combining these readings,
determines whether the car should turn left, right, go straight, or stop.
